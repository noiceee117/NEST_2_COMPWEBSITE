I built the NeST Digital website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure a professional and responsive design. The site features a Bootstrap navbar for seamless navigation across Home, Business Units, and Contact Us pages. The homepage includes a carousel slider showcasing images, along with structured sections presenting the company's mission, vision, and industry expertise. The Business Units page highlights major sectors like Mobility, Healthcare, Industrial, and BFSI, using Bootstrap cards for an organized layout. I integrated Google Fonts and custom CSS to enhance the visual appeal. Future improvements may include interactive elements and additional dynamic features for a more engaging user experience.
